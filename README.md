# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by John Q. Student* 

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

Hooked up vibration thing as supposed to, used extra wires to hold them in place, used 100 ohm resistor 

[Video to be added here]

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Signal is control -- connect to 9, brown is ground, red is power

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

Digital pin 9 -- PWM pin, and in the code we are defining it as pin 9 as the pin where the servo is attached

VIDEO HERE

CHANGE PARAMETERS IN THE SKETCH TO MAKE SERVO SWEEP SLOWER OR OVER A SMALLER ANGLE

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

FIGURE THIS OUT LATER (SWEEP CODE)

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
